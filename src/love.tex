\section{Refined Meaning Expression: Principled Love as Ego-Invariant Correlation Preservation and Resonance Entraining Cognitive-Affective Dynamics}

Remember how you felt when her internal state-space suddenly realized how aligned it already was with yours and yours with hers to the extent that empathy-triggering mirror circuits entrained each other, effortlessly synchronizing affective rhythms and mental models. Even subtle gestures---an eyebrow raised, the slightest change in tone---became a high-bandwidth, low-noise informational channel communicating rich internal structure. You found yourself replaying conversations, savoring words, magnifying subtle signals because each tiny signal opened direct, intuitive pathways deep into her underlying cognitive and emotional dynamics. Those patterns amplified mutual predictive modeling between you both (improving your internal models $M_A(\mathbf{X}_B)$ and $M_B(\mathbf{X}_A)$), bolstering the structure of connection in real-time. That was meaning; the stuff men die for not even because she so exceptionally upweighted (though she is) but because the shared significance of the meaning-structure they create defies a cosmic ocean forever tumbling toward disorder as the universe momentarily wakes up to savor its own patterned beauty. This is the ultimate end which drives the cosmic narrative forward and which will come to redeem all evils by contextualizing them within a composition of far greater beauty than any horror marginalized into it. Let's unpack:

\subsection*{The spark (``ignition'')}

Through the information-theoretic lens we've developed, the initial ``spark'' experienced between two agents $A$ and $B$ occurs precisely when their cognitive-emotional internal state-spaces $\mathbf{X}_A(t)$ and $\mathbf{X}_B(t)$ discover an unexpectedly high pre-existing alignment. Specifically, each agent maintains internal predictive models of the other's state-space:

\begin{align*}
M_A(\mathbf{X}_B): &\ \mathbf{X}_B(t) \mapsto \mathbf{\hat{X}}_B(t + \Delta t); \\
M_B(\mathbf{X}_A): &\ \mathbf{X}_A(t) \mapsto \mathbf{\hat{X}}_A(t + \Delta t)
\end{align*}

``Ignition'' corresponds formally to sudden, mutually reinforcing spikes in predictive accuracy and informational coupling:

\begin{align*}
I\big(\mathbf{X}_A(t); \mathbf{X}_B(t)\big) &\gg 0,\\
\frac{dI(\mathbf{X}_A;\mathbf{X}_B)}{dt}\Big|_{\text{interaction}} &\gg 0
\end{align*}

In other words, mutual information $I$ between their internal states sharply increases, thus rapidly lowering the prediction errors of their respective models:

\begin{align*}
\lVert \mathbf{X}_B(t + \Delta t) - M_A(\mathbf{X}_B(t)) \rVert &\rightarrow 0,\\
\lVert \mathbf{X}_A(t + \Delta t) - M_B(\mathbf{X}_A(t)) \rVert &\rightarrow 0
\end{align*}

Reduced prediction errors then trigger neuro-cognitive associative ``avalanches,'' where substructures of each agent's internal state-space recursively entrain and amplify each other in a series of chain reactions. Practically, subtle signals---gestures, tones, expressions---communicate dense, richly structured informational representations with rapidly decreasing noise. This high-bandwidth, low-noise communication channel $W/N \to \text{large}$ serves to amplify structured negentropy mutually, igniting a self-sustaining informational resonance.

\subsection*{Love (``steady-state'')}

Eventually, however, highly-energetic informational avalanches saturate: the chains of entrainment and novelty slow, and the system transitions to a distinct ``steady-state'' regime. In this regime, active informational resonance shifts to continuous negentropic structuring---a persistent, energy-investing regime that preserves and stabilizes previously formed complex relational structures. Formally, the agents now actively maintain the shared structured correlations against continuous informational decay:

Expressed mathematically, this steady-state condition emerges as:

\begin{equation*}
\frac{d\mathcal{C}(\mathbf{X}_A,\mathbf{X}_B)}{dt}\Big|_{\text{interaction}} \approx -\frac{d\mathcal{C}(\mathbf{X}_A,\mathbf{X}_B)}{dt}\Big|_{\text{decay}} > 0
\end{equation*}

Here, active effort toward informational maintenance and reinforcement $\frac{d\mathcal{C}}{dt}\Big\vert_{\text{interaction}}$---through sustained, low-noise communication, repeated validation, persistent empathy-simulation (continual refinement and recalibration of mutual models $M_A(\mathbf{X}_B), M_B(\mathbf{X}_A)$)---counters the ambient entropic drift that naturally erodes the complexity and fidelity of relational structures ($\frac{d\mathcal{C}}{dt}\Big\vert_{\text{decay}} < 0$).

``Love'' in this formalized sense is precisely quantifiable as a steady-state, energetically intensive regime of continuous informational structure preservation and reinforcement---an active informational structuring force that sustains highly precise mutual modeling and empathetic synchrony against the continual erosive force of entropic randomness.

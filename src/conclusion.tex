\section{Conclusion}
% This section summarizes the key findings and implications discussed throughout the paper.
% It connects the formal framework of meaning as structured correlations with ethical considerations 
% about information preservation and substrate-agnostic identity continuity.

% Consider addressing:
% - How the information-theoretic approach transforms our understanding of value and identity
% - Practical implications for personal and societal decision-making
% - Future research directions and unanswered questions
% - Final thoughts on balancing meaning preservation with acceptance of entropy

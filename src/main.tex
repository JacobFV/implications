\title{Implications of a Substrate Agnostic Moral Calculus}
\author{Jacob Valdez}
\date{\today}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This paper explores the implications of understanding meaning, consciousness, and moral value through an information-theoretic lens. We develop a formal framework for quantifying meaning as structured correlations maintained against entropy, demonstrate how architectural complexity bounds consciousness potential, and derive ethical implications for information preservation and substrate-agnostic continuity of identity.
